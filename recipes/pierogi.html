    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pierogi are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savoury or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water. They are often pan-fried before serving.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups of flour</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li> 1 large egg</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough: Mix together the flour and salt. Add the egg to the flour and combine. The dough will be quite clumpy at this stage.</li>
        <li>Work in the sour cream and soft butter until the dough comes together in a slightly rough, slightly sticky ball.</li>
        <li>Using just your fingertips, knead and fold the dough without adding additional flour until the dough becomes less sticky but still quite moist.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
    </ol>
